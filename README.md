# ⚠️ Important Notice
Currently, I am in the process of rewriting Larascord from the ground up. This rewrite is aimed at enhancing Larascord's performance, reliability, and overall user experience.

As of the latest update, Larascord is at version 5.1.1. During the rewrite process, Larascord will not receive any updates, except for those related to security enhancements. This decision is made to allow me to focus my efforts entirely on completing the rewrite efficiently and effectively.

I would like to inform you that with the release of version 6, <u>breaking changes should be expected</u>.  Detailed documentation will be provided to assist you in transitioning smoothly to the new version.
